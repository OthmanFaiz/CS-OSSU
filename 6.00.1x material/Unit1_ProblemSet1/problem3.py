# Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

# Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
# In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

# Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
# Note: This problem may be challenging. We encourage you to work smart. If you've spent more than a few hours on this problem, we suggest that you move on to a different part of the course. If you have time, come back to this problem after you've had a break and cleared your head.



# Image result for substring definition In other words you can say that beginIndex is inclusive and endIndex is exclusive while getting the substring. For example â€“ "Chaitanya". substring(2,5) would return "ait" . It throws IndexOutOfBoundsException If the beginIndex is less than zero OR beginIndex > endIndex OR endIndex is greater than the length of String.
